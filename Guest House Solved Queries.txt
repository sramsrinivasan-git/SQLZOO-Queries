Solution:
=========
WITH sample as(
select s2.last_name, s2.first_name f1 , s1.first_name f2, row_number() over (partition by s2.last_name order by s2.last_name) as row# from 
(select booking_date , first_name, last_name, nights from booking b1 join guest g1 on b1.guest_id=g1.id) s1
join
(select booking_date , first_name, last_name, nights from booking b2 join guest g2 on b2.guest_id=g2.id) s2 on 
s1.last_name=s2.last_name and s1.first_name<>s2.first_name AND ((s1.booking_date BETWEEN s2.booking_date and DATEADD(day, s2.nights-1, s2.booking_date)) 
OR 
(s2.booking_date BETWEEN s1.booking_date and DATEADD(day, s1.nights-1, s1.booking_date)))
group by s2.last_name, s2.first_name, s1.first_name)
select last_name, f2 as first_name, f1 as first_name from sample where row#=1


Problem Satement 12 :

Check out per floor. The first digit of the room number indicates the floor â€“ e.g. room 201 is on the 2nd floor. For each day of the week beginning 2016-11-14 show how many rooms are being vacated that day by floor number. Show all days in the correct order.

Solution:
=========
select [Check-Out Date] as i , [1] as [1st], [2] as [2nd] ,[3] as [3rd] from(
select DATEADD(day, nights, booking_date) as [Check-Out Date], LEFT(room_no,1) as Floor, count(guest_id) as [Check-Out Count] from booking
where DATEADD(day, nights, booking_date) BETWEEN CAST('2016-11-14' as date) AND DATEADD(day, 6, '2016-11-14')
GROUP BY DATEADD(day, nights, booking_date), LEFT(room_no,1)) s1
PIVOT (SUM([Check-Out Count]) for Floor in ([1],[2],[3])) as PivotTable

from booking where room_type_requested='single' and datepart(month, booking_date)=12 and datepart(year, booking_date)=2016) s1 left join
(select room_no, booking_date, dateadd(day, nights, booking_date) as check_out_date ,ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by room_no order by booking_date) as row#
from booking where room_type_requested='single' and datepart(month, booking_date)=12 and datepart(year, booking_date)=2016
)as s2 on s1.room_no=s2.room_no and s1.row#+1=s2.row# 
where datediff(day, s1.check_out_date, s2.booking_date)>=3 OR datediff(day, s1.check_out_date, s2.booking_date) IS NULL
order by s1.check_out_date
